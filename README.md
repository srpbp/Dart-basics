Hi everyone! 👋  
I'm on a journey to really get good at **Dart** (mostly because I want to build cool stuff with Flutter, but also because Dart is honestly super pleasant to write).

This repo / file is my living progress notebook — short explanations, favorite patterns, things that surprised me, and code I want to remember.
